# WeatherPy Discussion

The WeatherPy challenge collected weather observation data from around the world.  The following obersvations were drawn from the data I collected (WeatherPy_20210420_data.html) and the sample data (WeatherPy_with_sample_data.html) provided in the course assignment.

## Observation 1 - WeatherPy_20210420_data.html

I hypothesized that I would see a Maximum Temperature gradient from equatorial to polar latitudes because temperature is strongly influenced by solar irradiance.  As a result temperature will generally be correlated with Latitude, except for times of year where the solar irradiance is more equally distributed (Fall and Spring).  

My final API query was run at ~2:30pm on 4/20/2021. The resulting dataset showed negligible correlations between Latitude and a variety of weather observations.  I believe this is due to the timing of the data collection in the spring time in mid afternoon.  


## Observation 2 - WeatherPy_with_sample_data.html

The cities.csv data provided in the course assignment showed a measurable Max Temperature gradient. The data was sampled one month later in the calendar year and supports my hypothesis that there would be a gradient in Maximum Temperature.

## Observation 3 - Both datasets

The other observed weather conditions showed negligible correlation by the r-values associated with the data.  This makes sense because humidity, cloudiness and wind speed are impacted more by local geography and weather systems than by solar irradiance (aka Latitude).
